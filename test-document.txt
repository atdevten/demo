COMPANY LEAVE POLICY

1. ANNUAL LEAVE

All full-time employees are entitled to annual leave based on their length of service:
- Employees with less than 1 year of service: 12 days per year
- Employees with 1-5 years of service: 15 days per year
- Employees with 5-10 years of service: 20 days per year
- Employees with more than 10 years of service: 25 days per year

Annual leave must be requested at least 2 weeks in advance through the HR system. Approval is subject to business needs and manager discretion. Unused annual leave can be carried forward to the next year, but a maximum of 5 days can be carried over.

2. SICK LEAVE

Employees are entitled to 10 days of paid sick leave per calendar year. Sick leave can be taken for personal illness, medical appointments, or to care for an immediate family member. For absences of 3 or more consecutive days, a medical certificate is required. Sick leave does not accumulate and unused days do not carry over to the next year.

3. PERSONAL LEAVE

Personal leave of up to 3 days per year is available for urgent personal matters that cannot be scheduled in advance. This includes family emergencies, personal appointments, or other unforeseen circumstances. Personal leave requests should be submitted as soon as possible, preferably on the day of absence.

4. MATERNITY AND PATERNITY LEAVE

Female employees are entitled to 16 weeks of paid maternity leave. This can be taken starting from 4 weeks before the expected due date. Male employees are entitled to 2 weeks of paid paternity leave, which must be taken within 3 months of the child's birth or adoption.

5. BEREAVEMENT LEAVE

Employees are entitled to 5 days of paid bereavement leave for the death of an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent, or sibling). For the death of extended family members (grandparents, in-laws), 2 days of paid leave are provided.

6. PUBLIC HOLIDAYS

The company observes 10 public holidays per year. These include New Year's Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, National Day, and other government-declared holidays. If a public holiday falls on a weekend, employees will receive a compensatory day off.

7. LEAVE REQUEST PROCEDURE

All leave requests must be submitted through the online HR portal at least 2 weeks in advance, except for sick leave and emergencies. The request should include:
- Type of leave
- Start and end dates
- Reason for leave (if applicable)
- Contact information during leave

Managers will review and approve or deny requests within 3 business days. Employees will receive email notification of the decision.

8. LEAVE BALANCE AND TRACKING

Employees can check their leave balance at any time through the HR portal. The system automatically tracks all leave types and provides monthly statements. It is the employee's responsibility to monitor their leave balance and plan accordingly.

9. UNPAID LEAVE

Unpaid leave may be granted for extended absences beyond available paid leave. Requests for unpaid leave must be submitted at least 4 weeks in advance and require approval from both the immediate manager and HR department. Unpaid leave is typically granted for educational purposes, extended travel, or other special circumstances.

10. LEAVE DURING PROBATION PERIOD

Employees on probation (first 3 months) are entitled to pro-rated annual leave. However, leave during probation is generally discouraged and requires special approval from the department head.

11. RETURN FROM LEAVE

Employees returning from leave of 5 days or more must notify their manager at least 2 days before their return date. A return-to-work meeting may be scheduled to discuss any updates, changes, or necessary training.

12. ABUSE OF LEAVE POLICY

Abuse of the leave policy, including falsifying leave requests or taking unauthorized leave, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
